        Hello! I'm Mark. I'm a 2nd year GDD student at RIT taking Intro to Game Web Tech. 
        My main interests are video games (obviously) but I also dabble around in car stuff 
        and gaming peripherals. My goal is to just make something. At all. It doesn't have to 
        be good, or even decent, but I just want to make something that at least I or someone 
        else out there can enjoy. Hopefully I could do that before graduating or at least only
        shortly after.
    </p>
